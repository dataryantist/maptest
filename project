<b>Section 1</b>

  <br>It’s no secret that the COVID-19 pandemic has changed how we view work. From the widespread lockdowns to the prevalence of mask-wearing, 
  there’s not a worker that hasn’t been impacted by the new safety measures. One of the groups feeling the effects of this the most are working parents. 
  Changes in how the education system operates and the desire to minimize the risk of exposure are some of the reasons that have caused many from this 
  group to exit the workforce. This not only hurts employers looking for workers but also the parents needing money to take care of their families. 
  One of the challenges that we are facing is how to encourage these people to rejoin the labor force while ensuring their safety and well-being.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here we will look at the areas of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, that have the highest risk of impact from this, potential obstacles, 
  and ways we can lessen the impact of COVID-19 on working parents and the local labor force.
  
<br>A recent survey from Cleo has shown that the number of families that have considered or have had one or both parents leave their job, 
reduce hours, or take a leave of absence has risen throughout the course of the pandemic.

One of the topics we will discuss is remote work. A recent survey from Catalyst shows that access to remote work lessens the chance that women 
responsible for childcare are less likely to leave their job. Another key finding from this survey was that access to remote work made all employees 
30% less likely to look for another job in the next year.

<b>Section 2 (Story)</b>
<br>Since working parents are at a higher risk of leaving the workforce, knowing where they reside will allow for more targeted efforts. 
    While there are many parents in the area, it’s also important to acknowledge the different subsections of the group so that we can 
    understand the unique challenges each may encounter. The following maps show where, in Mecklenburg County, the parents with the highest 
    risk reside and highlight some of the challenges they may face.
